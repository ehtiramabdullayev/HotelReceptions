# HotelReceptions
Scenario
We want to help Hotel Receptionists with mail management by building a software system. This software
system should be able to:
- Allow receptionists to see when guests will check-in and checkout of their hotel stay
- Allow receptionists to decide whether or not to accept guest packages
- Allow receptionists to see if packages are available for pick-up when the guest is checking out
- Allow receptionists to see what packages belong to what guests
- Allow for guests who forgot to pick up their package after checkout to collect it at a later date
- Allow guests to check with reception for their package at any time
- Allow guests to get their packages from reception
